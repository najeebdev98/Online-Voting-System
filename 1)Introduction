Student union elections play a crucial role in universities and institutions as they ensure democratic representation and foster active student engagement. However, traditional manual voting systems have several drawbacks that hinder the smooth conduct of elections. Long queues, limited polling stations, and time-consuming processes can discourage student participation. Moreover, the lack of robust authentication methods makes these systems vulnerable to errors, tampering, and fraudulent activities. To overcome these limitations, Campus Polls, an advanced online voting system, has been developed. It provides a secure and efficient platform for students to cast their votes remotely, eliminating the need for physical attendance at polling stations. The incorporation of eye blink authentication adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that only authorized individuals can participate in the voting process. By implementing Campus Polls, universities and institutions can overcome the logistical challenges associated with manual voting systems. Students no longer have to endure long queues or face limitations due to limited polling stations. They can conveniently cast their votes from anywhere with internet access, saving time and effort. The system's robust authentication mechanism, utilizing eye blink verification, prevents unauthorized voting and enhances the overall security of the electoral process. The introduction of Campus Polls addresses the need for a secure and efficient online voting system that fosters student engagement and ensures the integrity of student union elections. By providing a convenient and accessible platform, it empowers students to exercise their voting rights and strengthens democratic representation within universities and institutions.
